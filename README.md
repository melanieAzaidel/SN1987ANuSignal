# SN1987ANuSignal

This repository is a recipe for facilitating a small project for a first-year undergraduate student majoring in Physics/Astronomy. This project is designed to be completed over eight weeks and was originally designed for the Polaris Mentorship Course at The Ohio State University. The files within include both tasks for the student working on this project, as well as setup material and context for the mentor leading the project.

In this project, the student will learn about neutrinos and supernovae in order to calculate an upper limit on the mass of the electron neutrino using neutrino observations from SN1987A. To do so, the student will be introduced to special relativity and order of magnitude estimates in astronomy.
