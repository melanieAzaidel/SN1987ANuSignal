    "This is a Jupyter notebook. Essentially, it is a way to interactively run Python code. Notebooks are composed of cells. Cells contain either Markdown (a simple language for presenting text like this cell) or code to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's quickly talk about Markdown. Double click on this cell to reveal the Markdown code within. You can see some simple formatting within here, and find a [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to formatting if you follow this link. If you are familiar with html, this is similar (or can be used somewhat interchangeably I think). To go back to a nice looking text-cell, hit option-enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will look into coding aspect of notebooks. As far as I am aware, notebooks can be used in almost any language. We will be using Python, which is the language that many people have adopted for data processing. It is a language with many purposes though, which stems from its open nature. In this notebook, I will provide most of the code and give you hints of where to edit it to make things run as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's start, first we will define some variables and run some basic code. In this format, I still prefer to do most of the writing in Markdown cells, but also include comments in the code. In Python, comments are lines that begin with a \\#. My philosophy is to include longer thoughts, etc in Markdown cells, and the more step-by-step instructions in the comments. For the first bit of code, we will do some simple printing of variables and their \"types\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the following cells in this notebook all the way through and then execute the code they contains by hitting 'Shift+Enter'."
